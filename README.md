# Codex Jinx

*"A playbook of tricks, tips, and techniques for aspiring pentesters and CTF enthusiasts."*

Codex Jinx is a curated knowledge base designed to help learners, CTF players, and junior pentesters systematically approach challenges. This playbook focuses on methodology, checklists, and practical guidance — all within a safe and legal environment. It’s meant to teach you **how to think like a pentester**, not to run illegal exploits in the real world.
